# Prepare a release branch using VERSION file as source of truth.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/prepare-release.sh
#        DRY_RUN=1 ./scripts/prepare-release.sh  # test without commit/push
#
# This script:
#   1. Reads version from VERSION file (must be bumped manually beforehand)
#   2. Validates VERSION looks like valid semver
#   3. Creates a release branch
#   4. Syncs VERSION to sqlite-vec.h and package.json
#   5. Commits and pushes the release branch
#
# Outputs (for GitHub Actions):
#   - Writes branch=<name>, version=<version>, and commit=<sha> to
#     $GITHUB_OUTPUT if set
#
# Developer workflow:
#   1. Manually bump VERSION file (e.g., 0.4.0 → 0.4.1)
#   2. Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
#   3. Commit: git commit -am "release: prepare v0.4.1"
#   4. Trigger release.yaml workflow
#   5. The workflows build, tag, stage, and wait for maintainer 2FA approval
#
# Why VERSION is source of truth:
#
#   - Clear and transparent: "The version is whatever VERSION says"
#   - Prepare releases: Update CHANGELOG for new version before workflow runs
#   - Git history: Version bumps are explicit, visible commits
#   - Standard practice: Similar to Go modules, Rust crates, etc.
#
# Why this release flow exists:
#
#   1. RELEASE BRANCH ISOLATION: VERSION sync happens on a release/vX.Y.Z
#      branch. Main is untouched until everything succeeds.
#
#   2. CORRECT VERSION IN BINARIES: All platform builds check out the release
#      branch, so the version in sqlite-vec.h is baked into every binary.
#
#   3. OIDC AUTHENTICATION: The tag-bound publish workflow uses OpenID Connect
#      with GitHub's identity provider, with no long-lived npm token.
#
#   4. PROVENANCE ATTESTATION: The publisher starts at the signed release tag,
#      so npm provenance identifies the same commit that built the package.
#
#   5. HUMAN APPROVAL: CI stages the package; a maintainer reviews and approves
#      it with 2FA before npm makes it public.
#
# See .github/workflows/release.yaml and .github/workflows/publish.yaml.
